#
# Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.
#
# The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the
# root node down to the nearest leaf node.
#
# Note:Â A leaf is a node with no children.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
# Output: 2
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: root = [2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]
# Output: 5
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10^5].
# -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
#
#

# @lc code=start
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def minDepth(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        if root is None:
            return 0
        else:
            left = self.minDepth(root.left)
            right = self.minDepth(root.right)
            if left == 0 or right == 0:
                return left + right + 1
            else:
                return min(left, right) + 1
